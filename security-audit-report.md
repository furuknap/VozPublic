# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase, with a focus on API keys and other sensitive information. The audit revealed several security concerns that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the application.

## Findings

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys and Credentials

**File:** `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
**Severity:** High
**Issue:** Hardcoded Supabase URL and Publishable Key.

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = "...";
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = "...";
```

**Risk:** Hardcoded API keys in source code can lead to unauthorized access if the code is exposed (e.g., in a public repository). Even though this is a publishable key with limited permissions, it's still a security risk as it could be used to access your Supabase project.

**Recommendation:** Move the Supabase URL and key to environment variables. Use a `.env` file for local development and secure environment variables for production deployments.

### 2. Exposed Project ID

**File:** `supabase/config.toml`
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** Supabase project ID is exposed in the configuration file.

```toml
project_id = "vukcthyeuodshukzyjiv"
```

**Risk:** While the project ID alone may not grant access to your Supabase project, it can be used in combination with other information to target your project.

**Recommendation:** Consider moving this configuration to environment variables or a secure configuration management system.

### 3. Insufficient Environment Variable Usage

**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** The application does not use environment variables for sensitive information.

**Risk:** Without proper environment variable usage, sensitive information may be hardcoded in the source code, leading to potential security breaches.

**Recommendation:** Implement environment variable usage for all sensitive information, including API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.

### 4. Incomplete .gitignore Configuration

**File:** `.gitignore`
**Severity:** Medium
**Issue:** The `.gitignore` file does not explicitly exclude `.env` files or other files that might contain sensitive information.

**Risk:** Without proper `.gitignore` configuration, sensitive files might be accidentally committed to the repository.

**Recommendation:** Update the `.gitignore` file to exclude `.env` files and other files that might contain sensitive information.

## Recommendations

### 1. Implement Environment Variables

Replace hardcoded credentials with environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (and add it to `.gitignore`)
2. Add your sensitive information to the `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-url.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

3. Update the Supabase client to use these environment variables:

```typescript
const SUPABASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;
```

### 2. Update .gitignore

Add the following to your `.gitignore` file:

```
# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local
.env.production.local
```

### 3. Implement Secure Authentication Practices

The current implementation uses Google OAuth, which is a secure authentication method. Continue to use OAuth providers instead of implementing custom authentication when possible.

### 4. Regular Security Audits

Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.

### 5. Use a Secrets Management System

For production environments, consider using a secrets management system like AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secret Manager, or HashiCorp Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information.

## Conclusion

The security audit identified several security concerns that should be addressed to improve the overall security posture of the application. By implementing the recommendations provided in this report, you can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches and unauthorized access to your application and data.
